# Introduction
This GitHub Repository represents the backend of the YACOID project. The frontend GitHub Repository can be found here: [yacoid-frontend](https://github.com/DenisKnecht02/yacoid-frontend). The backend uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a database. To create the different REST endpoints the framework [fiber](https://gofiber.io/) was used. To authenticate users and manage users and roles the provider [Authorizer](https://authorizer.dev/) was used.

There are two workflows: **Development** and **Production**. The main difference between those is that the Production workflow creates the Docker image of the API automatically and launches the API, Authorizer and MongoDB as Docker containers. The API and Authorizer then use the same MongoDB. In the Development workflow the API uses the locally running MongoDB and Authorizer uses a MongoDB inside a Docker container.

# Prerequisites
1. You have MongoDB installed and running. The Community Server can be downloaded here: [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). It is also recommended to have [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) installed, because you can view the data in a GUI.
2. You have Docker installed and running. Docker can be downloaded here: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). On windows you may have to add Hyper-V as a feature and enable virtualization in your BIOS. This [StackOverflow Thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39684974/docker-for-windows-error-hardware-assisted-virtualization-and-data-execution-p) can help.
3. You have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed.
4. *(optional)* You may want to have [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) installed to easily test requests. A template file, that can be imported into Insomnia, can be found inside the folder `misc`.

# Common pitfalls
1. Entering an URL in a `.env` file
   
      **Problem**: If you configure a `.env` file and need to enter a URL, then you need to remove the last slash at the end of the URL. Otherwise there can be wrong redirect or the authentication does not work.

      **Solution**: Remove the last slash in the URL. For example, change `http://localhost:8080/` to `http://localhost:8080`

2. Entering a password in a `.env` file

      **Problem**: If you configure a `.env` file, need to enter a password (for example like in `ADMIN_SECRET`) and your password contains a "#" character, the "#" character and the characters after that will be interpreted as a comment.

      **Solution**: Enclose your password with " characters. For example:
      Change your current line: `ADMIN_SECRET=abc#123` to `ADMIN_SECRET="abc#123"`

# Workflow for Development


## Setup Authorizer

1. Copy file `.env.auth.sample` and rename it to `.env.auth`
2. Configure the auth environment in the file like here:

```properties
# https://docs.authorizer.dev/core/env

ADMIN_SECRET=
ENV=development
DATABASE_TYPE=mongodb
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://database:27017 # database is the name of the docker container
ROLES=user
PROTECTED_ROLES=moderator,admin
```

3. Go into the scripts folder and execute the `start_authorizer.bat` script (docker must be running)
4. The Authorizer Dashboard is now available under <http://localhost:8080/>
5. When logging in enter the password specified in `ADMIN_SECRET`
6. The Authorizer Instance should now be successfully configured and can be accessed

<br/>

## Setup API

1. Copy file `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`
2. Configure the api environment in the file like here:

```properties
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
REST_PORT=3000

AUTH_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH_ADMIN_SECRET=
AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8080
AUTH_REDIRECT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

3. To fill `AUTH_CLIENT_ID` do the following:
   1. Navigate into `Environment > OAuth Config` in the Authorizer Dashboard
   2. Copy the client id
   
4. `AUTH_ADMIN_SECRET` needs to be the same as `ADMIN_SECRET` from the `.env.auth` file

## Start the system
1. Run the command `go run .` or `air` in the project root folder
2. The individual API endpoints can be accessed under <http://localhost:3000/>

<br/>
<br/>

# Workflow for Production

## Setup Authorizer
1. Copy file `.env.auth.sample` and rename it to `.env.prod.auth`
2. Configure the auth environment in the file like here:

```properties
# https://docs.authorizer.dev/core/env

ADMIN_SECRET=
ENV=production
DATABASE_TYPE=mongodb
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://database:27017 # database is the name of the docker container
ROLES=user
PROTECTED_ROLES=moderator,admin
```
<br/>

## Setup API

1. Copy file `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env.prod`
2. Configure the api environment in the file like here:

```properties
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://database:27017"
REST_PORT=3000

AUTH_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH_ADMIN_SECRET=
AUTH_URL=http://authorizer:8080
AUTH_REDIRECT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

3. If you already successfully started Authorizer in development, then you can fill the existing `AUTH_CLIENT_ID`. Otherwise this will be done in the next steps.
4. `AUTH_ADMIN_SECRET` needs to be the same as `ADMIN_SECRET` from the `.env.prod.auth` file

<br/>

## Start the system
1. Go into the scripts folder and execute the `start_production_system.bat` script (docker must be running)
2. If you already filled `AUTH_CLIENT_ID`:
   1. The system is now successfully running
   2. The Authorizer Dashboard is available under <http://localhost:8080/>
      1. When logging in enter the password specified in `ADMIN_SECRET` in the `.env.prod.auth` file
   3. The API endpoints are available under <http://localhost:3000/>
3. If you didn't fill `AUTH_CLIENT_ID`:
   1. Then the first time the Docker container `yacoid-api-container` will fail to start, because the `AUTH_CLIENT_ID` is missing in the `.env.prod` file.
   2. To fill `AUTH_CLIENT_ID` do the following:
      1. The Authorizer Dashboard is still available under <http://localhost:8080/>
      2. Navigate into `Environment > OAuth Config` in the Authorizer Dashboard
      3. Copy the client id
   3. Now terminate the current process and repeat the current section `Start the system`
